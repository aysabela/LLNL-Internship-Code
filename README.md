# LLNL-Internship-Code
Hi! This is a collection of the different code I wrote for my internship at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. It is currently a work in progress as of (11/18/2020)

My first project involved me pulling data of different OS from different departments and counting them. This was written in Bash.
My second (and bigger) project involved me utilizing a network management software called Zabbix. I had to write an autoregistration script to deploy agents
onto a user-inputted system after going through a series of checks this used Bash and vi commands. I also had to write a monthly report script that displayed the most relevant 
details we wanted regarding triggers that were set off (disk-free, server down, & CPU Load among others) in different servers by querying a mySQL database. It was written in PHP for the query and sendmail and HTML for the formatting. Currently, I am working on upgrading a very old website written in HTML & Fortran.
